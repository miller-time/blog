   Hi, my name is Russell. I'm a Computer Science student at
   Portland State University. This is a relatively new website
   I've created, and I'm not a web developer or designer. This
   is mostly for me to have a place to write a personal blog
   to write about my experiences with programming, school,
   work, and whatever else I feel like writing about. 
   <br /><br />
   I'd like to give some background about this site. When I've
   been at the school lounge area I've heard and seen a lot of
   people talking about their blog. I have never really had one.
   I did have a LiveJournal back in the day, and every once in
   a while I would post things on it. I'm not really interested
   in having a personal journal anywhere, but I did want an account
   of all things programming that I work on, as a way to look back
   at what I've done. Even looking back at some of the stuff I've
   done over the last year I don't remember it very well. I was
   hoping to log some of my challenges and thoughts in a way that
   if I ever need to relearn a language I used to use, or solve
   a problem similar to one I've solved, I've got a great reference.
   So this site isn't plugged in a lot of places, I don't like to
   brag about it, it will never host ads, and I don't really care
   if nobody reads what I write.
   <br /><br />
   I was accepted to MECOP and will be starting this Spring. 
   I've put a link to their site on my links page. I'm extremely 
   excited about Computer Science and programming. I've done some work
   with C, lots with C++, some Java, some Haskell, and some Python.
   This website runs on Django which is a Python web framework.
   I like to post my code online, feel free to check it out on my
   Github, which is also on the links page.
