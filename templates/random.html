<h3>Totally Random</h3>

<p style="font-size:13px">
  It turns out that having a website means you think of completely random things
  that HAVE to be on the internet. I have been cluttering my site with these 
  things, thinking I was making it more interesting. Well, I couldn't bring 
  myself to delete them when "Spring Cleaning" came aroung, so they're gathered 
  here.
